A collection of fusion360 files of keyboards I made when I was super into trying to design my own.  All files were printed by me on my ender3v2 and fit the boards they were designed for.

# Mode80 case 
I had an extra PCB from a mode80 group buy so made this to house it.

# Sava60 
Interchangable weight design inspired by the detachable weight of the unikorn. Uses mounting points and PCB of the open-source bakaneko by kkatano.

# Copement 
Goofy little project. Loved JJW's moment keyboard and wanted to see if I could replicate the curves. Ended up having it ordered and printed in resin from a Chinese factory. 

# Deckbox 
A deckbox design that holds two 50 single-sleeved decks for standard size TCG cards. 

# Angel60
Uses mounting points/PCB of kkatano's bakeneko, but outside is heavily modified. Design on the underside is based on Exusiai from mobile game Arknights
